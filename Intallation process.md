### Installation and configuration process for application execution ###

Multi-agent simulation
---------------
In case you want to make any modifications to the general behavior of the cars, it will be necessary to download the multiagents.IPYNB file, for which you will need an environment capable of working with this format. As an example, Visual Studio Code and the Jupyter extension would suffice. Before being able to run this we will need to install the libraries such as AgentPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, JSON, Math and IPython as these allow the full operation of the code. By following these steps you will be able to run the code and thus be able to generate the JSON file to use it in the graphic simulation.

Graphic simulation
---------------
In order to run the project correctly it will be necessary first to keep all the files as they were provided in the project folder (in case of having generated a new JSON file it will be necessary to change it for the current one in the folder). Once we have downloaded the project, we will open it in Visual Studio Code and select the file called simulation.html. Next, to be able to execute this file, it will be necessary to have the Live Server extension (in case of not having it just go to the VSC extensions section and look for it and then just install it and it will be enough) so that when pressing the "Go Live" button the file starts to execute in a browser tab and thus to be able to see the simulation running.
