# Multi-agent simulation of a Traffic intersection 

### My contribution - Front-end dev: Aldo Alejandro Degollado Padilla 
This was a group project for the course TC2008B at Tec de Monterrey. It consisted of a multi-agent system in Python that simulated a traffic intersection in which cars and traffic lights were agents and, given certain inputs, simulated the operation of a crossroad intersection.

I worked as a front-end dev with a slight focus on the back end tasks. I was in charge of the camera(s) placement and the road, cars and skybox models integration. Together with my front-end colleagues, we developed the system to read the data of the position of the cars and the status of the traffic lights, both generated by the Python program. Last but not least, I helped the back-end team develop the program logic behind the code.

Technologies Used
---------------
### Programming Languages
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Python

### Technologies
- Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries
- Three.js
- AgentPy
- NumPy

How to run
---------------
In order to run the simulation you need to open the "Proyect" folder using VS Code and with help of the Live Server extension, launch the server to run the scene. If you want to run the Python part too, you will need to install AgentPy, run the Python server and then run the Jupyter Notebook.
